The growing in power visual language of branding has contributed to the rising levels of monotony and homogeneity. What can be the positive contributions of the introduction of sophisticated, designed characters and narratives to the world of creative direction. What are some properties of narrative that can be used in design and analysis processes? What is the relationship between narrative and the database? This paper examines the real and potential opportunities given to designers by introducing certain elements of fiction, fantasy, or certain narrative methods. It does it through a series of stories, reviews and interviews regarding works that have been considered widely successful and utilised the aforementioned methods.

In this context Iâ€™m interested in the methodologies that are making an attempt on squeezing as much meaning as they can from a certain situation, character, scenery. I would like to know more about the non-visual processes that come before the production process of the visual assets. The stories and contexts of coming up with the characters and narratives. Is there a way to extract knowledge out of the processes that stand behind those works and how can they influence the creative scholarship of graphic design and my practice in particular, as I tend to have difficulty with such a free way of synthesising ideas.
