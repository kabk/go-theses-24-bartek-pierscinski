						With Gummo I wanted to create a new viewing experience with images
						coming from all directions. To free myself up to do that, I had to
						create some kind of scenario that would allow me to just show
						scenes, which is all I care about. I can't stand plots, because I
						don't feel life has plots. There is no beginning, middle, or end,
						and it upsets me when things are tied up so perfectly.

						Korine claims the storyline is deliberately weak. "I can't stand the
						idea of plot. It's nothing to me. All I remember from movies - from

						"It was a very visual approach, like the idea of a photograph," says
						Mr. Korine. "Say I wanted to see a blind girl sitting on a toilet
						seat. That was the image I would start with, then I'd go over what
						would happen and what should happen in the scene and direct the
						actors in that way. Most of the dialogue is improvised.”

						**Korine:** Well, like I think every movie there needs to be a
						beginning, middle and end, but just not in that order (laughter),
						and like when I watch movies, the only thing I really remember are
						characters and specific scenes. So I wanted to make a film-making
						system entirely of that, really random. > > **Letterman:** Right.
						You would like the phone book better if it were not alphabetized,
						right? > > **Korine:** Yes, I like the phone book. It's good

				<blockquote>
					<div class="quote">
						I know that people say that there's no narrative in vaudeville, but
						I think there is a narrative and there's a definite narrative in
						Gummo. It's just maybe more hidden, it's more the idea that the
						narrative comes through the idea of association, just by virtue of
						the scenes being kind of run along, put next to each other, that a
						narrative forms. It's like looking at a book of private photos.
						There's a picture of you in front of a castle or maybe a monument.
						And next to that is a picture of your grandfather on the toilet. And
						next to that is a picture you took of Michael Jackson. If you looked
						at them on their own without knowing the context, then they would
						seem singular or random. But just because one is next to the other,
						a kind of narrative comes through. That goes along with Gummo.
						That's how Gummo was written.
