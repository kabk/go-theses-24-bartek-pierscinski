					An interesting discovery can be made while studying the collection of
					interviews with Harmony Korine: in practically every interview he
					mentions one aspect of filmmaking, that not only practically
					characterizes his view on film and literature, but also exemplifies
					the connection between his oeuvre and the database–narrative ideas
					that drive this text. Never once expressing his realization about him
					repeating himself on this topic in every single interview, Korine
					keeps bringing up his views on the scene’s superiority over the
					plot[1]. He sometimes rationalizes this by explaining this ideology’s
					resemblance to the ideology of life in general, but also by how
					focusing on scenes relates to the implicit marketing pragmatics of
					movies and how, in fact, at the end of the day only singular scenes
					remain in a viewer’s memory after a visit to a cinema.
				</p>

				<p>
					I find those ideas and the emphasis on the scenes as another a spot-on
					illustration to the “Database Cinema” theory[2]. It is important to
					think about the scenes of a Korine script like photographs, because
					after writing a voluminous database of those, the editing process
					becomes the process of selecting the best and putting them into the
					script like into a photobook. In a 2019 interview at the Gucci Hub in
					Milan[3], Korine admits to the usage of cue cards in the process of
					writing “Gummo”, to even stronger emphasize his prioritization of
					scenes.

					A striking example of the application of Korine’s scene-based approach
					can be found in the script for his 1999 feature film “julien
					donkey-boy”[4]. Uncovered only to those who buy the “Collected
					Screenplays 1” book, the “instruction” to the understanding of the
					script reads:
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					<div class="quote">
						This is a non-traditional script design. The order in which the
						scenes are written should serve as a ver broad skeletal frame. I am
						only using them a as a guide which the story is hung upon. (…) The
						written scenes have no particular order.
					</div>
				</blockquote>

				</figure>
				<p>
					In the same interview at the Gucci Hub, Korine opens up even more
					about his approach to filming/performing the pre-written scenes. Still
					on the topic of “Gummo”, he describes filming the same scenes many
					times in many arrangements and locations, therefore creating an even
					larger database and letting the narrative creation process happen
					during the editing and in the minds of the spectators. The alternative
					performances of the scenes that are instances of a database are
					related in absentia in the final cut of the film, so they only exist
					in the mind of the moviemaker and the viewer, if they are imagined. I
					consider this an interesting illustration of the existence of
					Manovich’s paradigmatic sets related in absentia and existing only
					implicitly.
