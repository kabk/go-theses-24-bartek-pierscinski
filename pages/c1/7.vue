					One of the other illustrations to the database-oriented methods of
					representation can be found in Harmony Korine’s script of the
					never–produced movie “Jokes”. The screenplay starts with a disclaimer
					about the its nontraditional nature and announces the database-like
					structure.

						jokes is a separate undertaking, written in conjunction with the
						former. it is a movie in three parts. each chapter so to speak is
						based on a milton berle joke, usually a one-liner in the vein of
						henny youngman. basically i picked three separate jokes and
						embellished each one in order to stretch out a simple narrative of
						sorts. at the time i was watching all the alan clark films i could
						see and i was very much excited by his technique, his use of long
						flowing steady cam, no frills organic filmmaking. so i was inspired
						to approach each joke/chapter in a similar way, a return to a place
						i had never before felt any interest.

					What follows is according to the introduction—a short script, of which
					every “chapter” begins with a joke told by the main character of the
					following story. The stories: tautly constructed, highly imaginative
					and show his intuitive sense for emotion, tenderness, and of course
					the bizarre. The result: intriguing, thought-provoking and shocking
					journey leaving the viewer with more questions than answers. As a
					movie should and as life always does—claims Korine.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this particular example, it’s interesting to think about the script
					as a translation of the narrative style of Henny Youngman's
					“one-liner” joke performances into a movie script and achieving a
					similar effect on the viewer. The fragmentation of the narrative
					creates tension and impedes the process of interpreting the story by
					the viewer. The more fragmented the structure and the more implicit
					the narrative, the receiving process gains in attentiveness and
					alertness. The “jokes” script reads in a shocking and convoluted
					manner and additionally gains even more complexity with the
					juxtaposition of the specific joke preceding the chapter and the
					content of it.
