					As a high-school student diving into the vast rabbit holes of internet
					content connected by its relation to Harmony Korine, I stumbled upon a
					video that gave me an insight into the equally vast chaos of rules
					that govern Korine’s brain. More importantly, though, it left me with
					a method that was easy for me to understand, analyze and potentially
					use.

				<p>
					In the legendary status YouTube video Korine is being interviewed by
					Chase Whale (or rather Chase Whale is unsuccessfully attempting to
					interview him). Right at the beginning Korine completely ignores a
					question about his latest movie “Thrash Humpers” and says “Well,
					first, one second… I’m gonna draw some dots!”. He then proceeds to
					explain and demonstrate his method for coming up with scenes and
					writing, and calls it “basically his favorite thing to do”. He
					proceeds on rambling that he likes to draw a bunch of dots on a
					whiteboard, connect them in a pattern that he claims represents “a
					brain of a fox” and next to the dots, he starts writing seemingly
					unrelated words. After the diagram is ready, what it takes is to just
					use the rules of grammar to start combining the words into sentences
					that have a syntagmatic value. One can proceed to create a sentence
					after sentence utilizing the power of this diagram and potentially end
					up with a short story. Despite first connecting the dots in a specific
					way there are virtually no rules and the “user” of the diagram has
					complete freedom to take it in any direction they want.
				</p>
				<p>
					Seeing this video after reading about Manovich’s “Database Logic”, I
					connected the dots (pun intended) and realized the obvious: Korine’s
					method is simply an exact, dumbed-down illustration to Manovich’s
					theories about the database as a basis of the narrative and
					syntagmatic aspects of database instances. In the video, we see that
					from this specific database of words Korine (but possibly also
					virtually anyone else) unveils the potential and implicit narrative.
					Despite the visual “interface” of the database, the diagram has a
					“random-access” form and therefore the role of decoding it and
					extracting the syntagmatic links remains on the “user”.
				</p>
				<p>
					This method not only serves as an exact illustration to the theory
					that I’m dealing with in this text and comes from Korine, whose work
					is also the starting point of this text. It can also serve as a great
					tool and reference for creating stories and narratives (potentially
					also visual narratives assuming a modification to the method or the
					form of the instances). Again: as a graphic design student, who was
					never academically trained in writing and narratives, I am not aware
					of the existence of other helper methods like this one. I assume there
					are many out there, but I believe that this particular method is valid
					and worth focusing on in the context of my research.
