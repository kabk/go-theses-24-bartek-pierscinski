					Funnily enough, the aforementioned Manovich’s article about the
					database-narrative approach continues with a subchapter about
					“Database Cinema”—a description of certain filmmakers’ attempts at
					creating non-linear, interactive, implicit narratives using this
					specific medium. It points out the obsoleteness of the modernist
					notion of medium specificity, about how every medium should develop
					its own unique language, and states that the contemporary cultural
					climate demands the reevaluation of cinema as a medium prioritizing
					narrative (through time-based sequencing as opposed to e.g.
					photography as a medium prioritizing database—through existing mostly
					as part of random-access mediums, such as catalogs, taxonomies, and
					lists). Given the new dominance of the database with the introduction
					of digital media and the internet, there comes up a possibility of
					arriving at new narrative methods that take into account that its
					elements are database instances.

					He cites Peter Greenaway and Dziga Vertov as two practitioners of the
					methods that work to sabotage the idea of a “plot” and emphasize the
					potential of the database–narrative symbiosis. With Greenaway,
					Manovich points to his methods of using certain systems of pretty much
					just making sense of the sequencing of the recorded video material.
					With Vertov, who Manovich calls a “database filmmaker”, there is an
					interesting way of “activating” the usually static form of the
					database into something more dynamic and spirited. Vertov’s methods
					include for example a meta-narrative technique of beginning the movie
					by filming the editing room and particular captioned shelves with
					numbered and catalogued shot material. Vertov’s relevance to new media
					is the creation of new meaningful visual language for film through the
					means of a particular argumentation of the sequencing and manipulation
					of seemingly unrelated clips—he merges database and narrative into a
					new form.

						material existence; other elements which form an imaginary world of
						an author or a particular literary or cinematic style and which
						could have appeared instead exist only virtually. Put differently,
						the database of choices from which narrative is constructed (the
						paradigm) is implicit; while the actual narrative (the syntagm) is
