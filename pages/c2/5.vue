					My fascination with the Parco Japan 2020 Spring/Summer seasonal
					campaign video began when I was still a high-school student. I found
					it while browsing through the work of Frank Lebon and other
					photographers/creative directors of the Lebon family. Initially, I
					think I was attracted to it because of the creative energy emanating
					from it and the fact that I simply was not sure what I was looking at.
					The videos (because I was slowly starting to realize that the whole
					campaign encompasses multiple of them and also other media such as
					photography and set/window design for the stores) guide the viewer
					through a tale about the adventures of four superheroes inhabiting the
					streets of London. The idiosyncrasy of the narrative lies in the rapid
					tempo of the presentation of those stories and scenes. The ad lasts 20
					seconds and during that time you follow the four “Heroes’” (title of
					the campaign, one hero per season of the year) seeing them navigate a
					multitude of scenes and situations, of which some of them appear on
					the screen only for a split second. All that is accompanied by a piano
					piece by Joe Armon-Jones.

					After thinking about it more I think that what made this stand out to
					me so much is the extreme level to which the narrative and
					storytelling methods were utilized in such a rapid slideshow of
					images. Everything seems to be working very well together here, the
					set designs, the make-up and costumes, the choreography and design—to
					me: a handbook example of the usage of those, along with the filming
					and editing, with the goal of creating an entrancing visual narrative
					from seemingly very simple ingredients. It’s the music score that
					constitutes the magical aspect of the perception of the work. The
					hopeful sound implies a future for the characters, making the tale
					that much more engaging.

					This campaign sent me out on a constant lookout for those works that
					recklessly break the conventions of (fashion industry) marketing
					campaigns. I’ve been in pursuit of specific embodiments of visual
					communication methods that could still entertain and tell stories,
					interesting scenes, that felt like slices of life.
