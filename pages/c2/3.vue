					Upon further examination of the subject matter, some conclusions
					become evident. Certain narrative and creative tools carry on being
					widely unused in the advertising and creative industries. At this
					stage, I would risk saying that the absence of these elements serves
					as a defining characteristic for a work that aligns with the
					aforementioned monotonous market of interchangeable clichés. I mean in
					this text to create an affiche for specific methods for visual
					communication that utilize the ideas of story and its telling. The aim
					is to render creative works produced through these techniques more
					lifelike by leveraging the power of storytelling. Similar to how
					stories are there to help us make sense of the world, the works in
					question have the potential to enhance our understanding of the
					subjects or objects they communicate.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the sake of specificity, I’d like to restrain myself to talking
					about an aspect or rather an often-mentioned negative trait of
					creative works which is “lack of character” and suggest an
					introduction of one as a stupidly simple method of fighting the
					problem at hand. I am not oblivious to the fact that this kind of
					suggestion might seem exactly as absurd as it is straightforward.
					Instead of striving for being “characteristic” in the sense of just
					having idiosyncratic, specific features that differentiate it from the
					rest of the same kind (in the aesthetical, formal, or conceptual
					dimensions), I suggest an introduction of a character or characters in
					the other meaning. According to the theory brought forward by Ira
					Newman in “Virtual People: Fictional Characters through the Frames of
					Reality”—a character simply as a person occupying a place in a
					narrative.

					Seeing this video after reading about Manovich’s “Database Logic”, I
					connected the dots (pun intended) and realized the obvious: Korine’s
					method is simply an exact, dumbed-down illustration to Manovich’s
					theories about the database as a basis of the narrative and
					syntagmatic aspects of database instances. In the video, we see that
					from this specific database of words Korine (but possibly also
					virtually anyone else) unveils the potential and implicit narrative.
					Despite the visual “interface” of the database, the diagram has a
					“random-access” form and therefore the role of decoding it and
					extracting the syntagmatic links remains on the “user”.
				</p>
				<p>
					The method I suggest in this text is looking at specific examples of
					creative campaigns that harness the wide scope of possibilities
					provided by the deliberate usage of database aesthetics, storytelling
					and characterization. I would like to take a closer look at works that
					take on this seemingly ridiculous strategy to—as a result—enable
					interactive, engaging, and customized brand experiences in design,
					transforming our perception and interaction with visual narratives.
