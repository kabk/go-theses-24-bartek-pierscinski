It has been of great interest to me, setting of to doing the research for this paper, the methods and techniques leading to the creation of such complex, yet dissociated narratives as the ones introduced above. It was not an easy process and the most valuable results came from the most unexpected sources found accidentally, but I was eventually happy to have stumbled upon some clues that help me get an understanding of the creative process behind the discussed works. </p><figure><img src="'+d+'" alt=""><figcaption> From &quot;History of the World: Part 1&quot; (1981), Dir. Mel Brooks </figcaption></figure><p> As I already mentioned, the starting point to my adventure with idiosyncratic narratives has been “A Crack-Up at the Race Riots”. Even though a search for one plot line will most likely turn out to be fruitless, it doesn’t take away from the amusement value of Korine’s writing. It’s as entertaining as it is intriguing and leaves you questioning yourself and curious as to whether maybe there was a clear metaphorical plot or whether the two-chapter structure signified something intelligible. </p><p> Reading Lev Manovich’s article “Database as a Symbolic Form” somehow directed me to insightful ways of thinking about that book. First it talks about the narrative—database opposition in the context of both classic narrative media such as books or movies and new-media objects. </p><blockquote><div class="quote"> Literary and cinematic narratives work in this way. Particular words, sentences, shots, scenes which make up a narrative have a material existence; other elements which form an imaginary world of an author or a particular literary or cinematic style and which could have appeared instead exist only virtually. Put differently, the database of choices from which narrative is constructed (the paradigm) is implicit; while the actual narrative (the syntagm) is explicit. </div><div class="caption">Lev Manovich</div></blockquote><p> His claim that new media reverses those relationships of traditional narrative media—database (the paradigm) is tangible, concrete, while narrative (the syntagm) is de-materialised—finds a great application in Korine’s book. The database, so in this case the contents of Korine&#39;s hyperactive mind are given a material existence as printed words on paper, while the narrative (which in a traditional novel would be THE explicit, tangible thing) can only exist in the viewer’s imagination, becomes somehow the responsibility of the viewer. </p><p> Another interesting aspect of the book is that it becomes truly a random-access medium (which in Manovich’s opinion a book already is). It favours the database structure and allows for it’s reading from all kinds of different directions and sequences. It is truly more of an instance of an encyclopedia than it is a novel. There is no indexing or lineage other than the sequence of the pages and the separation of the content of the book into two chapters. In Manovich’s words: there is no algorithm, no explicit, direct interface that allows for structured navigation of the database to the viewer. The viewer is welcome to create their own. </p></div>',1),v={class:"refs"},f=e("div",{class:"index"},"[1.1]",-1),w=e("div",{class:"content"}," Kohn, Eric. “Nashville. Harmony’s House.
